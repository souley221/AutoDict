a Russian investor based in this city, thought he had the perfect name for a Catholic church that he is spending $11.5 million converting into a tech palace. It would be called Hack Temple.
But that was before the nearly daily deluge of news about Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election by hacking computers and using Facebook and Twitter to spread inflammatory messages and sow division.
We had so many concerns from our investors saying this would be inappropriate and we should change it, said Mr. Cherkashin, 44, who planned to officially open Hack Temple this fall. A bunch of Russian guys opening a hacker
 temple in the middle of San Francisco at a time when Russian hackers are considered the most evil in the world. They say you can not.
